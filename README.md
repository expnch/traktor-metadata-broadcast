traktor-meta-broadcast
========================

This is a web server that captures metadata from [traktor-api-client](https://github.com/ErikMinekus/traktor-api-client) and broadcasts it using GStreamer. This can be used to enhance your live performances beyond Traktor's native broadcast functionaliy, which only provide track title and artist formatted for Icecast.
